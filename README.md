# PHP-Font-Parser

A PHP OpenType font parser, capable of extracting glyphs
from TrueType and CFF OpenType fonts. TrueType collections
are not supported (yet).

Have a look at fonttest.php to see an example on how to
use this package.

:warning: Note: this project hasn't been actively maintained for over
half a decade. If you still use this, and have problems with
modern PHP, fixing that is going to be more work than I can
justify spending on this, so you'll need to help out.
