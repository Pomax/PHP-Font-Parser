		This is a class representation for parsing, not creating. That means tables are not fully parsed
		until they are necessary, and the CMAP and glyph tables are never stored in memory, but
		are only referenced by following the pointer instructions that are stored in the tables
		relevant to glyph retrieval.
		
		This has a benefit that the memory footprint is small, but the disadvantage that processing
		is not as fast as when the font would be properly turned into an object representation and
		then flown through at the speed of RAM.
		
		Future versions might be rewritten to memory-map a font, so that pointer based reading
		is faster than it is now. However, this may also make PHP run into the memory limit when
		particularly large CJK fonts are loaded. The Hanazono font, for instance, is not an unusually
		large font and takes up 23 MB. This is almost double the size of the standard 12MB that
		a typical PHP installation is set up to use.
		
		Currently, only the "Unicode BMP (UCS-2)" and "Unicode UCS-4" are searched for character
		implentations. If the script claims "not supported", that really means "not supported by this
		parser, but not necessarily not supported by this font".
